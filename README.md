# Typst Assignment Template

A simple assignment template for [Typst](https://typst.app/).

## Example Usage

You can find an example [here](./example.typ) as well as its render [here](./example.pdf). 

## Status

I haven't used this extensively *yet* so I don't know what weird behaviors might be lying around,
I'm quite new to this. Feel free to use it and let me know if you find any issues!

Any feature requests or ideas to improve this/make it more configurable are welcome!

Not sure if I'll introduce some form of versioning even before package management makes an
appearance in Typst but it is something I'll keep in mind if I keep making frequent (breaking)
changes.
